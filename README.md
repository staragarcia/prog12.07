## Accomplished tasks

Our group successfully implemented a range of classes to represent various SVG objects: Ellipse, Circle, Polyline, Line, Polygon, and Rectangle. Additionally, we developed the logic to read and parse SVG files for these elements, allowing both their drawing and the application of transformations (translate, rotate and scale).
We also achieved the implementation of group elements. However, our current implementation is limited to groups that do not contain nested groups, and also only have a "group transformation" and not other element transformations inside.
